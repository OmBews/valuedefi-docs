IOU tokens - vBONDs were issued as part of a compensation plan for affected parties after the November 14th exploit.

**Implementation:** - One way VBOND (ETH) bridge to BSC to receive **VBOND-B**. 

**VBOND-B** will be a rebasing token to simulate interest and will permanently rebase positively, on every Monday equaling approximately 10% APR.

**60/40 VBOND-B/gvVALUE-B** [vFarm](https://bsc.valuedefi.io/#/vfarm/0xd56339F80586c08B7a4E3a68678d16D37237Bd96/32) will be set up and will receive vBSWAP as incentives for liquidity providers

**Paying Back the Debt**: VALUE from the [Insurance Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb7b2ea8a1198368f950834875047aa7294a2bdaa) and [Compensation Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2b52472950cda46fb3369eff2719e144699f3a07) will be bridged to gvVALUE-B. These funds will be used to incrementally buyback 50k VBOND-B weekly, and then burn it. This purchase will only occur if VBOND-B is trading under $1. The principal being, once all VBOND-B has been burned will mark that user funds will have been fully reimbursed.
