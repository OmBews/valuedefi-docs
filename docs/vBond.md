IOU tokens - vBONDs were issued as part of a compensation plan for affected parties post November 14th exploit. 
vBONDs auto-accrues 10% APY using rebasing technology which means that the rebasing factor is fixed at 0.183% every week. 
Currently, 15% of swap fees and 6% of Vault performance fees are diverted to the compensation fund as decided by VIP 10 vote. 
Compensation fund will be used to buy and burn vBONDs from VALUE/VBOND pool until the compensation fund has equal or
greater value than the supply of VBONDs at which time compensation fund will stop collecting fees and
all affected users will be able to swap their vBOND for DAI at 1:1 ratio.
