 **OVERVIEW**

vSwap is an automated market maker (decentralized exchange) that uses smart routing to provide its users with the best exchange rate, slippage, and price impact on the market. vSwap has the ability to launch pools, and swap most tokens with lower liquidity by ‘borrowing’ liquidity from other Dex’s such as Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap.

**KEY FEATURES**  
1. Allowing users to swap assets  
2. Smart routing
3. Connecting with other exchanges and using their liquidities
4. Supporting vPegSwap, a Solidity implementation of Curve’s StableSwap, which is considered a fully automated market maker for tightly pegged assets or stablecoins.
5. Providing liquidity to a pool in exchange for preferential swap fees 
6. Participating in vFarms
7. Using idle funds to give liquidity providers the most lucrative ROI (future integration planned)
