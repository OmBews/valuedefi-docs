 **OVERVIEW**

vSwap is Value DeFi's highly-competitive exchange (automated market maker) that allows users to trade their assets.

**KEY FEATURES**  
1. Allows users to swap assets for other assets  
2. Users can provide liquidity in a pool to enjoy swap fees  
3. Participate in vFarms  
4. Use the idle deposited funds to provide liquidity providers the most lucrative ROI

The end purpose of vSwap is to become one big vault that puts the idle assets in vSwap at use, while still keeping enough liquidity to prevent high amounts of slippage. Currently $11B in assets are stored in decentralized exchanges. Some of those assets are used to get swapped, which earns the liquidity providers some swap fees but most of them sit idle in the liquidity pools. To optimize the yield on these idle funds, they are put to use at farms and therefore increase the returns.
