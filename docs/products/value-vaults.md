**OVERVIEW**  

Our vSafes are high-tech yield aggregators that use multiple strategies and auto-compounding to provide investors with high returns on their deposited assets. In simpler terms, a vSafe will search for the best farming targets, deposit your investment, trade the rewards for the deposited tokens and re-invest automatically. 

The auto-pilot nature of our vSafes makes it so theyâ€™re very simple to use as no maintenance is required by the investors to increase their underlying asset size and value over time.

**KEY FEATURES**  
   1. _Auto-compound:_  

This saves you time, effort, gas and it ensures it gives you peace of mine that your maximizing your investment. To be clear, the LP count will not increase through auto-compound. It is the dollar value of the LP that will increase which means when you remove the liquidity, you will get a lot more tokens than what you had previously deposited.

   2. _Multiple strategy:_  

Our vSafes are interesting and unique in that they can use multiple strategies to farm multiple pools. This way you get the best optimal return by having your fingers in many pies.
  
The infographic below shows how we optimize the vSafe funds to increase yield. To prevent dilution of the APY of the farmed pool, only a part of the vSafe funds are allocated to it so that the pool APY is less affected. 

Using the example above, allocating $1M of our vSafe would bring the Farm to $2M TVL \(1M+1M\) provide us with 55% APY \(110%/2\).

This is also done for the remaining funds in the vSafe, those are distributed to use on other farms to acquire the best return on the deposited vSafe assets, resulting in for example a 50% APY compared to 10% with single assets.
