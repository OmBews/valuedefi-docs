Provide liquidity on vSwap

---

**vSwap allows users to provide liquidity to the vSwap exchange. Liquidity providers get a share of the fees when someone makes a trade against the token you have provided liquidity for.**

When you provide liquidity on vSwap, you will receive VLP tokens. Additionally, you can then use your VLP tokens to farm for Value Rewards.

**Lets provide some liquidity and get vSwap pool \(VLP\) tokens**

1. Go to [https://valuedefi.io/](https://valuedefi.io) and select the pool you want to farm in:

For this tutorial I’m going to provide liquidity for DAI/Value, for this I will receive VLP tokens. I can also use these tokens to farm Value.

2. You’ll see an icon to create a VLT for your selected pool. Click this to go to vSwap to create the token.

3. vSwap will open with the appropriate pairs. The VALUE/DAI pair requires 80% DAI and 20% Value. Add the amount of DAI you want to use and then click ‘Setup Proxy’.

_**Note:** Steps 3-7 are only required if your wallet has never provided liquidity before. If you have already set up the proxy skip to step 8._ _The proxy will allow farmers to use the new Liquid technology for flexible farming when the full roadmap is released._

I’ve received 5.85 VLP tokens for the Value/DAI pool.

**See your VLP tokens in your Metamask wallet:**

I’ve created a VLP token for the Value/Dai pair, I now need to add the contract address to Metamask so I can see them in my wallet.

1. Click the link shown below to get the contract address:

I’ve also edited the token symbol to include DAI/VAL so I can distinguish from my other VLPs
