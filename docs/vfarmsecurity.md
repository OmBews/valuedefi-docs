FaaS (vFarm) is permissionless and decentralized service/product of Value DeFi ecosystem and as such, we are not able to control who is creating the pools, however we do have three tab list of available vFarms 

First one is Official ValueDefi pools
![vFarmsecurity1](img/vFarmsecurity1.png)

These are the pools created by Value DeFi

Second one is Council verified
![vFarmsecurity2](img/vFarmsecurity2.png)

These are the projects that have been created by non Value Defi entities that have passed Council verification

FaaS council is a group of 11 community members that have been selected to do background checks on projects that create their vFarm on Value DeFi FaaS.
FaaS council checks social media presence, roadmap, tokenomics, contracts and gives out yay or nay vote to whitelist vFarm with simple majority.
However, FaaS council is not a professional auditing company and their whitelisting of projects is neither security guarantee nor investment advice, 
it is simply a body that is a placeholder until a full cross-chain Governance system is developed and implemented when VALUE stakers 
will be the ones that do whitelisting process.

The third tab is in-screening/unverified vFarms
![vFarmsecurity3](img/vFarmsecurity3.png)

These are the projects that got their vFarms created recently, did not contact ValueDeFi staff or community members to start the whitelisting process
or simply did not receive enough yay votes from Council. These vFarms usually have high apy so they can be considered high risk - high reward investments.
As FaaS is permissionless, Value DeFI has no control over those vFarms so please do your own research for each project that you plan to invest money in. 
Knowledge is your first and last line of defence against potential malevolent actors.

In case you ever suspect you invested in a project that may be fraudulent, every vFarm contract has an emergency withdrawal function
that you can use by following a few simple steps. However, this will also forfeit any rewards that you have accumulated over time and will just return your staked assets

Instructions done on metamask and PC and pictures will reflect that

Every vFarm has contract address in its upper right corner of your UI

Once you click on it you will be redirected to BSCscan address of that vFarm where you will be able to click contract
