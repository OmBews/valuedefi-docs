**How to use Chi Gastokens on vSwap:**

1. Access [vSwap](http://valueliquid.io)

2. Select 'Settings' in upper right corner

3. If you don't have Chi gastokens you can mint them on Value Liquid page or buy them from 1inch

4. Click ON on “Use Chi”

5. Approve Chi Gastoken spending

6. You can now trade and save up to 42% of gas fees

To save up gas on transactions, the gas fee at the time of burning has to be twice as much as what it was at the time of minting, for example, you mint Chi at 20 gwei and use/burn Chi when the gas price is above 40 gwei.
