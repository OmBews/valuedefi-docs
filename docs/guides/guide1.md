**How to use Chi gastokens on ValueLiquid:**

1. Buy/mint Chi gastokens from 1inch

2. Go to ValueLiquid.io

3. Select settings in upper right corner

4. Click ON on “Use Chi”

5. Approve Chi gastoken spending

6. You can now trade and save up to 40% of gas fees

To save up gas on transactions, the gas fee at the time of burning has to be twice as much as what it was at the time of minting, for example, you mint Chi at 20 gwei and use/burn Chi when the gas price is above 40 gwei.
