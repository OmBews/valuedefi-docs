**Value Liquid allows users to provide liquidity to the Value Liquid Exchange. Liquidity providers get a share of the fees when someone makes a trade against the token you have provided liquidity for.**

When you provide Liquidity on Value Liquid you will receive VLP tokens. Additionally, you can then use your VLP tokens to farm for Value Rewards.

**HOW TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY ON VALUE LIQUID**

1. Go to [https://valuedefi.io/](https://valuedefi.io/?a=38LtvF24F66mQ4V7ap3XMKoUruro) and select the pool you want to farm in

For this tutorial i’m going to provide Liquidity for DAI/Value, for this I will receive VLP tokens. I can also use these tokens to farm Value.

2. You’ll see an icon to create a VLT for your selected pool. Click this to go to Liquid to create the token.

3. Value liquid will open with the appropriate pairs. The VALUE/DAI pair requires 80% DAI and 20% Value. Add the amount of DAI you want to use and then click ‘Setup Proxy’.

_**Note:** Steps 3-7 are only required if your wallet has never provided liquidity before. If you have already set up the proxy skip to step 8._ _The proxy will allow farmers to use the new Liquid technology for flexible farming when the full roadmap is released._
