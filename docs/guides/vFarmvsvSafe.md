**vFarm Summary**  

vFarm - is a highly sophisticated liquidity mining pool that allows pool creators to set up vast amounts of parameters, including reward multipliers and rewards vesting, an option to reward their liquidity providers in a fair way while reducing selling pressure usually related to large quantities of tokens being suddenly released into circulation.

vFarms with vested rewards



Projects who decide to lock their rewards have details shown on UI at Rewards locked tab. Clicking on block number 6675734 will take you to BSCscan block countdown page where you can see approximate time left till that block gets validated


It is also block number where 70 % of rewards will start to get linearly released 

Clicking on the second block will show when 70% of rewards stop being released.




In this specific case it means that you are receiving 30% of rewards instantly for the first 30 days, but you are also accruing your rewards for 90 days that those rewards are released. During those 90 days you do not have to remain in vFarm to receive those rewards, they will be linearly released and you are able to claim them partially every block or claim full amount after vesting period ends. 

So in a graphic way it would look like this







**vSafe Summary**  

Our vSafes are cutting-edge yield aggregators that use multiple strategies and auto-compounding technology to provide investors with high returns on their deposited assets. In simpler terms, a vSafe will search for the best farming targets, deposit your investment, trade farming rewards for deposited tokens and re-invest automatically. 

The auto-pilot nature of vSafe makes it very simple to use as no manual maintenance is required to increase the size and value of invested assets.
