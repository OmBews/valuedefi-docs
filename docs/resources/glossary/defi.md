**Game Theory** = A theoretical framework for evaluating the outcomes of social situations.

**Impermanent loss \(IL\)** =  Impermanent loss happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The bigger this change is, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss. In this case, the loss means less dollar value at the time of withdrawal than at the time of deposit. 

**Liquidity** =  Liquidity is the ability of a coin to be easily converted into other coins.

**Liquidity Mining** = An form of cryptocurrency mining that supports work and transactions on a blockchain usually without expensive application or hardware-specific equipment required by older forms of cryptocurrency mining.
Rewards are provided to liquidity providers as a means to incentivize liquidity mining providers, in addition to growing and supporting a blockchain's user base.

**Liquidity Pool** = Is a pool of deposited funds meant to provide liquidity to a currency, network, or Smart Contract. There are usually incentives or rewards given to Liquidity providers..

**Marketcap** = Market Capitalization. A measure of the total funds invested in a company or project. This market cap of a coin, company, or project can be calculated by multiplying the asset's unit price by the total number of coins.

**Multisig Wallet** = A multiple signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that controls access and changes to one or more Smart Contracts. Community governed projects like a DAO often require multiple signers to approve a transaction before it will be executed.

**Return on Investment** = A measurement of the performance of an calculated by subtracting the current value of an investment from the amount invested and then dividing the total by the amount invested. (Current Value - Amount Invested)/Amount Invested

**Smart contracts** =  Smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.

**Slippage** =  difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed

**Stablecoin** = A type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to that of an underlying asset.

**Volatility** = A measurement of the variation in the price of something over a given period of time.

**Yield Farming** = Yield Farming is the process of putting tokens to productive use in a DeFi market. This is done to earn passive interest income. It requires manually searching protocols for the best interest rates. Or one can utilize a Yield Aggregator.
