**Automated market maker** =  Automated market makers are smart contracts that hold liquidity reserves \(or liquidity pools\) that traders can trade against. These reserves are funded by liquidity providers. Anyone can be a liquidity provider who deposits an equivalent value of two tokens in the pool. In return, traders pay a fee to the pool that is then distributed to liquidity providers according to their share of the pool. \(taken from [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-uniswap-and-how-does-it-work](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-uniswap-and-how-does-it-work)\)

**Impermanent loss \(IL\)** =  Impermanent loss happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The bigger this change is, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss. In this case, the loss means less dollar value at the time of withdrawal than at the time of deposit. 

**Liquidity** =  Liquidity is the ability of a coin to be easily converted into other coins.

**Smart contracts** =  Smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.

**Slippage** =  difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed
