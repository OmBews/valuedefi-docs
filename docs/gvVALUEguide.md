In this tutorial, we’re going to walk you through the step-by-step process on how to purchase $VALUE on vSwap, stake it in vGov on Ethereum Mainnet and bridge it over to BSC to receive extra rewards. For the sake of simplicity, we will be using https://metamask.io/ as the default wallet for this tutorial.

#### PART 1 - PURCHASE YOUR $VALUE TOKENS

There are many ways to purchase $VALUE but this tutorial will focus on our decentralized exchange; vSwap.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Go to https://valuedefi.io/ 
2. Click the “_Value Liquid_” button on the header
3. Connect your wallet to the site
4. Select the token you would like to exchange _from_
5. Select $VALUE as the token you would like to exchange _to_
6. Approve both tokens (one-time transaction). While cumbersome, this is a security measure in order to prevent malicious contracts from sending tokens you haven’t first authorized
7. Click on the ‘_Swap_’ button
8. Preview the transaction in the pop-up window of your MetaMask
9. Confirm the transaction request in your wallet and wait for a few minutes

Congratulations, you now own $VALUE tokens in your wallet!

#### PART 2 - OBTAIN YOUR gvVALUE TOKENS

**For users who are NOT in the vGov (Governance Vault) currently**

In order to obtain your gvVALUE tokens; which is the asset that will be bridged across the Ethereum Mainnet and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Mainnet, you will be required to stake your $VALUE tokens to the vGov (formerly known as the Governance Vault). **When you stake your $VALUE tokens to the vGov, your $VALUE will be wrapped into a new token called $gvVALUE. When you unstake your $VALUE from the vGov, your $VALUE tokens will be unwrapped from $gvVALUE. If you send your $gvVALUE to another wallet, that new wallet will be able to redeem the $VALUE tokens using the vGov."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Go to https://valuedefi.io/governance
2. Click the 'Stake' button
3. Enter amount you with to stake
4. Approve the one-time transaction and wait a minute
5. Click the 'Stake' button

Congratulations, your $VALUE tokens are now staked and earning profits from Value DeFi Ethereum ecosystem! As proof of ownership of your share in vGov, you should have received $gvVALUE tokens in your wallet! (refer to the paragraph above).
 
**You can add gvVALUE as custom token in your Metamask:**
    Token address: 0x49e833337ece7afe375e44f4e3e8481029218e5c
    Token symbol: gvVALUE
    Token of precision: 18
    
**Why is my gvVALUE amount lower than VALUE I staked**

vGov earns 35% of swap fees from vSwap and 16% performance fees from vSafes and it is autocompounded for all vGov stakers. Your gvVALUE amount will always stay the same (unless you stake more VALUE), but your VALUE amount will increase over time 
        
**For users currently staking in vGov but do not see gvVALUE in their wallet**

Check your wallet for gvVALUE and check vGov UI, numbers of both need to be the same, if they aren’t you need to unlock your gvVALUE by clicking “unlock“ button on UI, confirm transaction, and after it goes through you should see gvVALUE in your wallet

#### PART 3 - BRIDGE YOUR gvVALUE to BSC

Now that you have your gvVALUE tokens in your wallet, we will use the bridge portal to bridge your gvVALUE into gvVALUE-B.  The two assets are pegged 1:1 and you may use this portal to bridge your gvVALUE and gvVALUE-B back-and-forth as needed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Select BSC bridge on Value DeFi UI
2. Select asset you want to bridge over (vUSD or gvVALUE)
3. Approve (one time transaction)
4. Select amount that you would like to bridge over
5. Select BSC address
6. Bridge over

2. Select 98/2 gvVALUE-b/BUSD pool
	In order to stake in this pool you need to have 98% of USD value in gvVALUE-b and 2 % of USD value in BUSD - you can preview your required amount by using staking UI and selecting max gvVALUE-B under it, required BUSD amount will be shown. You can use vSwap to buy neccessary BUSD
