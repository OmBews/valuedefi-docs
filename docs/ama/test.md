[10-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 When I first read about your

it?

[10-Apr-21 09:13 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 And your website is

[10-Apr-21 09:15 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Now about the Blockchain Adventurers
Guild.

This project has been in progress for a long time. It is the culmination
of a lot of research into governance, identity, and economics. With the
recent wave of interest in blockchain, DeFi, and NFTs many of us in the
space keep getting asked the same question.

How does one get started?

[10-Apr-21 09:16 AM] cbit3o\#6983 BAG aims to be the place that everyone
can start their journey into this world

[10-Apr-21 09:16 AM] cbit3o\#6983 thisistheway.finance - this is the way
to an entirely new paradigm of finance, governance, and identity

[10-Apr-21 09:17 AM] cbit3o\#6983 BAG aims to educate and reward members
at the same time. Getting paid to learn!

[10-Apr-21 09:18 AM] cbit3o\#6983 In the best case scenario, our
adventurers may consider BAG quests as a full time profession.

{Reactions} üî•

[10-Apr-21 09:19 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Ah, nice! I know that as a mod, I
have personally spent a good amount of time educating new users on the
what & how of crypto and DeFi specifically.

[10-Apr-21 09:19 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 This new space is rather complex
and if we want it to succeed, education is a critical piece of it.

{Reactions} üí∞ (4) ü§ì taphead

[10-Apr-21 09:20 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Is \$BAG your token? Can you give
us an example on how one would get paid to learn?

[10-Apr-21 09:21 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Are you going to challenge the
guild members with a set of quests?

[10-Apr-21 09:21 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Yes BAG is our DAO token. It is the
primary token for the guild. It can be verified at the below address.

https://etherscan.io/address/0xf33121A2209609cAdc7349AcC9c40E41CE21c730

[10-Apr-21 09:22 AM] cbit3o\#6983 People will get paid rewards for
successfully completing tasks which are submitted to the guild by
projects who are looking for active users.

{Reactions} üëè

[10-Apr-21 09:23 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Users not only get to learn about new
projects, but at the same time, they will be financially rewarded for
doing so! A win-win.

{Reactions} üí∞ üíØ

[10-Apr-21 09:24 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Ooo; so your project is NOT simply
about learning about crypto/defi in general. You actually plan to reward
users for learning about other projects too? Is that right?

{Reactions} ohoohooh taphead (2)

[10-Apr-21 09:24 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Completely right.

[10-Apr-21 09:25 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Quests may not only come from projects
on ETH, but also from projects on other chains or projects without
chains at all!

[10-Apr-21 09:26 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 That's pretty awesome. It makes me
want to create a quest right now for those who are reading the AMA üòâ

[10-Apr-21 09:26 AM] Prod\#4479 Can an individual quest involve more
than chain? Would be pretty interesting.

[10-Apr-21 09:28 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We know quite a few chain maximalists
who think their chain is the best, without even trying the other chains.

[10-Apr-21 09:29 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Do you plan to expand to BSC as
well?

{Reactions} Binance (5)

[10-Apr-21 09:29 AM] cbit3o\#6983 BSC will most likely be available in
Phase 2 right after launch.

[10-Apr-21 09:30 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We are in talks with many other chains
as well... SOL looks to be a close third after BSC.

[10-Apr-21 09:30 AM] Prod\#4479 Solana is on our radar too. Great chain!

[10-Apr-21 09:31 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 I have to admit, your brown paper
is pretty good for anyone who wants to learn about your project.
https://thisistheway.finance/The\_Blockchain\_Adventurers\_Guild\_Brown\_Paper.pdf

[10-Apr-21 09:31 AM] cbit3o\#6983 In fact, we expect that most of the
quest rewards will come from the bagjillion new chains that are
launching or have launched but have no users.

Looking at you ADA

[10-Apr-21 09:31 AM] cbit3o\#6983 This is the way

{Reactions} this (3)

[10-Apr-21 09:32 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Can you tell us more about
timing/roadmap/schedule? Are you officially launching in 27 minutes?
What about the different phases?

[10-Apr-21 09:32 AM] cbit3o\#6983 The Genesis Farm rewards officially
start in 60 minutes at https://thisistheway.finance [EDITED]

{Embed} https://thisistheway.finance/ Blockchain Adventurers Guild Want
to get started in blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and NFTs? This is the way.

[10-Apr-21 09:33 AM] cbit3o\#6983 The Genesis Farm will last for about
\~14 days

[10-Apr-21 09:33 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Immediately after this phase, we will
launch the BAG Gold minting phase and initiate BAG airdrops to partner
projects.

[10-Apr-21 09:34 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Maybe a month or two after that, we
will look to open up the Quest submission to 3rd party projects, whereby
they submit both the Quest and the Reward.

[10-Apr-21 09:35 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Creating an ecosystem with
educational quests with rewards; I like it :GWcmeisterPeepoLove:

[10-Apr-21 09:35 AM] cbit3o\#6983 BAG Gold or (BGLD) is going to be the
primary currency used within the guild marketplace and item shop.

[10-Apr-21 09:35 AM] cbit3o\#6983 BGLD can only be minted by staking
BAG.

[10-Apr-21 09:36 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Which is a reason to go and get your
BAGs now!

[10-Apr-21 09:36 AM] Prod\#4479 :pepeNaruto:

[10-Apr-21 09:38 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 @cbit3o - Awesome; is there
anything you would like to tell the audience before we open-up the floor
for them to interact with you and your team directly?

[10-Apr-21 09:39 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 :s5300:

[10-Apr-21 09:39 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Yes, I want to quickly explain what
the BAG token is and why it's important to hold it.

[10-Apr-21 09:39 AM] Prod\#4479 :takemymoney:

[10-Apr-21 09:39 AM] cbit3o\#6983 the BAG Token represents a share of
voting power and economics in the guild.

[10-Apr-21 09:40 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Not only can you propose and vote on
governance items.

[10-Apr-21 09:40 AM] cbit3o\#6983 You can also earn a share of passive
income by Staking BAG to earn BAG Gold as well as just by holding it.

[10-Apr-21 09:41 AM] cbit3o\#6983 BAG represents a share of the BAG
Treasury which is where all the fees go.

{Reactions} this

[10-Apr-21 09:41 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Fees are going to be generated, not
just by DeFi infrastructure projects such as lending, swaps, and pools,
but also by Quest Rewards and Marketplace Transactions!

{Reactions} wenmoon

[10-Apr-21 09:42 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Currently, 30% of quest rewards and
marketplace transactions will go towards the BAG Treasury

[10-Apr-21 09:43 AM] cbit3o\#6983 When a project like TRON or ADA or EOS
or KSM or DOT etc etc etc creates Quests and Rewards for our guild
members, they are also indirectly contributing to the BAG Treasury.

[10-Apr-21 09:43 AM] cbit3o\#6983 This means a BAG Token is in a
sense... a Bag.

[10-Apr-21 09:43 AM] cbit3o\#6983 of a lot of other tokens.

[10-Apr-21 09:44 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We would like everyone to be a BAG
Hodler!

[10-Apr-21 09:44 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Ok, please open the floor.

[10-Apr-21 09:44 AM] Prod\#4479 That's some super stacked incentives for
being a BAG holder!!

[10-Apr-21 09:44 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Very creating; you're really
mixing education + gaming all together üôÇ

[10-Apr-21 09:44 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 We need to open the chat to the
audience now... good luck!

[10-Apr-21 09:44 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 This is the way

[10-Apr-21 09:44 AM] cbit3o\#6983 This is the way

[10-Apr-21 09:45 AM] Prod\#4479 Gamification is an amazing structue.
This is the way

[10-Apr-21 09:45 AM] vTORCH.OG.2K\#6808 are you going teach people using
videos or scripts ?

[10-Apr-21 09:45 AM] Marco Polo\#5354 Test; 1 2 3

[10-Apr-21 09:45 AM] james boag\#9532 Hi what will the marketplace
contain?

[10-Apr-21 09:45 AM] xiaomaogy\#5157 Is there going to be BAG
distribution/farming event after the 14 days?

[10-Apr-21 09:45 AM] PixlRabt\#6224 What exactly do you envision these
quests entailing users to do?

[10-Apr-21 09:45 AM] jun\#9627 Will it be like rabbithole.gg?

[10-Apr-21 09:46 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 No reason videos can't be done.
Partner quest submitters accepted by the DAO might be interested in
using their marketing materials for their quests.

{Reactions} üëç

[10-Apr-21 09:46 AM] brakmaar\#8644 what kind of tasks will you propose
?

[10-Apr-21 09:46 AM] CosmicAnon\#5642 will the quests be story based or
having genres? eg. mystery, scifi or is it just up to the project using
BAG

[10-Apr-21 09:47 AM] siralex\#7862 Are you going to be able to buy on
centralized exchanges or only on DEXes?

[10-Apr-21 09:47 AM] notbrain\#8928 Hey I think BAG is a great project!
Really excited about it! Do you have any rough roadmap for chain
integrations and new quests?

[10-Apr-21 09:47 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We haven't thought of every type of
quest yet, but we are open to building a flexible structure for
submission and validation of quests. Even if that happens off chain.

[10-Apr-21 09:47 AM] cybenz\#0001 how are you planning on keeping the
community engaged

[10-Apr-21 09:48 AM] ColdNadongie\#2763 Bsc wen

[10-Apr-21 09:48 AM] schiccus\#6158 What kind of staker incentives for
BAG holders? What Will be initially APR?

[10-Apr-21 09:48 AM] cbit3o\#6983 BAG quests directly from the guild
will probably include some storyline for continuity. However, it will
not be limited to that for 3rd party quests.

{Reactions} rocket (2)

[10-Apr-21 09:49 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We have CEXes that are signing up as
partners and they are willing to list BAG. We can't announce these yet,
but there is interest. (CEXes want users to sign up and trade! So their
quests will be related to that.)

[10-Apr-21 09:49 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Primary volumes should be on DEXes
though...

[10-Apr-21 09:50 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 As long as there are airdrops,
there will be an easy audience for projects who seek to educate users
about themselves via the Guild.

[10-Apr-21 09:50 AM] james boag\#9532 thanks for answering

[10-Apr-21 09:51 AM] cybenz\#0001 how similar will they be to
coinmarketcap and coinbase earn rewards? in which ways will it differ or
be the same for example

[10-Apr-21 09:51 AM] jun\#9627 Are there extra incentives for the
genesis farm? Boosted APY?

[10-Apr-21 09:51 AM] cbit3o\#6983 APR is calculated automatically based
on the value of the reward received and the share of the pool. In our
case, we can't tell you what APR is going to be, however we understand
the fact that for BAG Gold to be a valuable reward, there must be
valuable things you can buy with it! To that end we are working on very
interesting and limited items in the Guild Marketplace and Item Shop.

[10-Apr-21 09:52 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 NFTs that you can attach to your
guild card and the sort. These may have special bonus traits üòâ

[10-Apr-21 09:52 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Yes.. we are also going to be issuing
Guild ID cards to members!

[10-Apr-21 09:52 AM] cbit3o\#6983 a digital guild id is in the works in
phase 2 or 3. We are working with designers now to make it happen. It
will hopefully be a self sovereign id by which 3rd parties can add
attestations to. Long term, we want to issue a physical ID card which
can be used to sign cryptographic messages like a ledger or trezor. But,
more importantly, to be a single sign on ID card for both online and
offline activities and 3rd party applications.

[10-Apr-21 09:53 AM] cbit3o\#6983 No multipliers

[10-Apr-21 09:53 AM] schiccus\#6158 Thanks

[10-Apr-21 09:53 AM] james boag\#9532 Will the 30 percent fee be
decreased overtime with larger adoption?

[10-Apr-21 09:53 AM] Risingashes\#6874 For the 14 days that staking is
live, what is going to create demand for the BAG being generated? What
will prevent it from approaching zero?

[10-Apr-21 09:54 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Coinbase earn's model was a big factor
in why we are taking 30% of rewards and putting them in the BAG
Treasury. The founder of coinbase earn disclosed that earn.com was
taking 50% of the rewards as their profit.

{Reactions} üëç

[10-Apr-21 09:54 AM] schiccus\#6158 Have you an Audit or programmed soon
to have One (Certik or other)?

[10-Apr-21 09:54 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 Don't see why not. Governance (BAG
holders) will have to vote on that when the time comes

[10-Apr-21 09:54 AM] cbit3o\#6983 In discussions with auditors. They are
all super busy, if anyone has a lead on how to skip the line please let
your ValueDefi admin's know and they will contact us.

[10-Apr-21 09:54 AM] Shual\#7534 What about a timelock on the contract?
Any things we should be worried about?

[10-Apr-21 09:54 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 This is the way. BAG is for the
people.

{Reactions} üëç

[10-Apr-21 09:55 AM] notbrain\#8928 will there be NFT made just for the
BAG community?

[10-Apr-21 09:55 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We had some feedback that the
community wanted a timelock. As of an hour ago, we have a timelock on
our contract. 0xE043Cf787843965812aAae79981d7353dC9ff720 is our 24 hour
timelock.

[10-Apr-21 09:56 AM] schiccus\#6158 I haven t sorry. Have you also asked
to Haechi?

[10-Apr-21 09:56 AM] cybenz\#0001 does the project have a social media
presence we can refer to when talking with friends

[10-Apr-21 09:57 AM] jun\#9627 How many devs currently working on the
project?

[10-Apr-21 09:57 AM] notbrain\#8928 re: social media - will there be
airdrops for social media engagement too? maybe additional AMA...

[10-Apr-21 09:57 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Hopefully, the fact that it is limited
and that BAG Gold staking comes immediately after. There are going to be
a maximum of 1 million BAG tokens created so you can easily calculate
the fully diluted market cap of the project.

We believe this is easily over a \$1bn marketcap project, but DYOR and
invest only what you can afford.

[10-Apr-21 09:58 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 We're gonna be launching a
partnership with a NFT project so expect some quests and NFTs
distributed as a result.

[10-Apr-21 09:58 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Have not contacted Haechi yet. Would
love a connect.

[10-Apr-21 09:59 AM] siralex\#7862 How much to make it you reckon?

[10-Apr-21 10:00 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 We've got a Twitter, Discord, and
Telegram. You can check out those links at the bottom of our website.

[10-Apr-21 10:01 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We currently have 3 full time devs

[10-Apr-21 10:06 AM] cbit3o\#6983 We are looking at adding compatibility
with non ETH style addresses. Blockchains use their own elliptic curves
whether it's Bitcoin and Secp256k1 or Monero with DJB's EdDSA

[10-Apr-21 10:07 AM] cbit3o\#6983 or QRL with Merkle tree based
cryptography

first? Any upcoming collaboration?

[10-Apr-21 10:09 AM] Bobo\_Fett\#7614 We've got a few official partners
that will be working directly with the Guild for our first series of
quests. Eventually the model will turn towards projects submitting their
quests to the DAO where they will be approved by members or not
depending on the benefits for the entire Guild

[10-Apr-21 10:09 AM] cbit3o\#6983 Marketing plan for user acquisition in
the first 1 or 2 phases is initially through collaborations like this.
In Phase 3, we want to start marketing quests and tutorials to the
general public!
