**OVERVIEW**

Launched in August 2020, Value DeFi is a platform containing a suite of products and services that aims to bring fairness, true value, and innovation to decentralized finance. 

**OUR CORE VALUES**
1. Increase accessibility to yield farming
2. Provide on-chain voting for governance
3. Reward our stakeholders with flexible, optimized and profitable pool strategies
4. Protect our community’s funds through the integration of an insurance treasury  

**OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCTS**
1. **vSwap**, an automated market-maker and decentralized exchange, that allows anyone to create custom liquidity pools with flexible ratio pairs and swap fees. 
2. **vPegSwap**, vPegSwap is a Solidity implementation of Curve’s StableSwap that is considered as a fully automated market maker for tightly pegged assets or stablecoins.
3. **FaaS and vFarm**, Farms-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a free decentralized self serving platform for any project to create fully customizable liquidity mining solutions which ultimately saves time and fees for everyone in the process. vFarm is the name given to a pool that was created through our FaaS service.
4. **vSafe**, yield aggregators that use multiple strategies to maximize the interest rate returns on users' assets.
5. **vTokens**, newly developed synthetic cross-chain algorithmic tokens. vTokens, in theory, can be developed on Ethereum, Binance and Polkadot while being pegged to any other token thanks to the support of Chainlink and their services.
6. **vGovernance**, major Value DeFi decisions are made by those who stake $VALUE to vGovernance and they also earn a portion of the profits made by the products of the platform.  

Value DeFi origially launched on the Ethereum Mainnet but it expanded in late February 2021 to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Mainnet.
