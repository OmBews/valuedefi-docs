**OVERVIEW**

Launched in August 2020, Value DeFi is a platform containing a suite of products and services that aims to bring fairness, true value, and innovation to decentralized finance. 

_We operate on four core tenets_:  
1. increase accessibility to yield farming
2. provide on-chain voting for governance
3. reward our stakeholders with flexible, optimized and profitable vault strategies
4. protect our communityâ€™s funds through the integration of an insurance treasury  

**OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCTS**
1. **vSwap**, an automated market-maker and decentralized exchange, that allows anyone to create custom liquidity pools with flexible ratio pairs and swap fees. 
2. **vPegSwap**, an automated market-maker and decentralized exchange, that allows anyone to create custom liquidity pools with flexible ratio pairs and swap fees. 
3. **FaaS and vFarm**, Farms-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a free decentralized self serving platform for any project to create fully customizable liquidity mining solutions which ultimately saves time and fees for everyone in the process. vFarm is the name given to a pool that was created through our FaaS service.
4. **vSafe**, yield aggregators that use multiple strategies to maximize the interest rate returns on users' assets.
5. **vTokens**, XXXXX
6. **vGovernance**, major Value DeFi decisions are made by those who stake $VALUE the the vGovernance and it allows the holders to influence the protocol and earn a portion of the profits made by the products of the platform.  

Value DeFi origially launched on the Ethereum Mainnet but it expanded in late February 2021 to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Mainnet.
