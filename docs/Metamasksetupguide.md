With upcoming expansion of Value DeFi on Binance Smart Chain, here is a quick guide to set up your Metamask wallet for BSC

If you don't already have Metamask wallet installed you can visit [browser extension marketplace](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)

Click import wallet if you have an existing wallet.

If creating new wallet, set up your password and write down and store your seed phrase somewhere safe.

*Note: recent update automatically adds BSC network settings to your Metamask wallet as soon as you click connect wallet*
