If you don't already have Metamask wallet installed you can visit [browser extension marketplace](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)

Click import wallet if you have an existing wallet.

If creating new wallet, set up your password and write down and store your seed phrase somewhere safe.

Next step is adding BSC network, in order to do it, click on Settings -> Networks -> Add network

Input network details as follows:

Network Name: BSC Mainnet

New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org/ or https://bsc-dataseed2.binance.org/

ChainID: 56, or 0x38 if 56 doesnâ€™t work

Symbol: BNB
