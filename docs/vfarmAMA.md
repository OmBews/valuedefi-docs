# Value Whose
 *Hello everyone, Welcome to our first vAMA session with Exhibition gallery, one of the vFarms listed on our FaaS. We invite everybody to join in, meet them and give them a warm welcome to our growing FaaS family. Thank you for being here Carlos Lugo and Miyasato Masa let's get started!*

# Carlos Lugo (Guest)
*Good morning*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Hey guys! How is everyone doing?*

# Prod
*Hello hello*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*We're happy to be here. Thank you vDodus and Prod for putting this AMA together
Thank you Value Whose for hosting us! We appreciate it.*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Hey guys! How is everyone doing?*

# Value Whose
*Doing great! Good morning/afternoon wherever you may be*

# Carlos Lugo (Guest)
*Yes thank you everyone*

# vDodus
*Ok guys, everybody ready then?
Tell us a bit about yourself, both of you.*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*My name is Miyasato Masa and I'm one of the co-founders of Miyasato Masa. I'll be managing strategy, business and community development on our platform.
I also paint abstract impressionism oil on canvas, which are heavily influenced by van Gogh, Picasso, and other masters.*

# Carlos Lugo (Guest)
*I'm Carlos Lugo the co-founder of EG, originally from Brooklyn NY. Started out as a street artist... and now I support EG with recruiting new talent and management.*

# vDodus
*There are more people in your team, right?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)

*Yes, we have a handful of contract developers helping us with the development of our website.*

# Value Whose
*Must be very talented. Did you have any to show today?*


# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Here's one oil on canvas that was completed in mid summer 2020.*




# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*This artwork was inspired by van Gogh love of sunflowers
And with some cubism added for dramatic effects.* 

# Prod
*Wow, amazing artwork. You both and your team are very talented*

# Value Whose
*Indeed this is awesome, I for one can appreciate art cause I am only good for stick figures*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*We all started somewhere, I also did the same too.*

# Value Whose
*I see we have real world art and you are also a crypto currency project. Could you explain more on how these intertwine together for your project and more on the process for those wanting to either make or buy some collections?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Sure. We believe legacy artworks and digital artworks such as NFTs are two sides of the same coin. Art begins from nothing. It’s an idea that originates from the artist’s mind, and then, translated onto canvas, paper, metal, and other media. At the end of this creation, something beautiful or thought provoking will embellish a blank white wall or enhance the atmosphere of a stark office space. At Exhibition Gallery (EG), we aim to foster those creations for all artists, while connecting artists with art lovers, art collectors, and art investors. Moreover, we will help turn your artworks and/or illiquid assets into a sustainable revenue source by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain.*

# vDodus
*That is great to hear, ever growing project. So what was the idea behind starting an Exhibition gallery?*

# Carlos Lugo (Guest)
*We would like to give artists a platform to share their work globally while moving into the future and incorporating crypto and blockchain technology.*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Our current art marketplace is fully functional; however, we're planning to integrate NFT functions too. Legacy artists will be able to make NFT, and NFT artists will be able to sell NFT on canvas.*

# Value Whose
*This will be a big one to get into NFT's are hot right now and will only grow in due time. Offering a platform for artists to monetize their work is a good thing.*

# vDodus
*I have read on your webpage that you also offer grants to artists, so there is also an altruistic segment of your project?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*In this pandemic, we all need some help either financial or other necessities. Our call for an artist grant is new, and we will distribute $300 each quarter to one artist.
It will provide a way for new and established artists to continue their artistic efforts, while gaining some exposure on our platform.*

# Value Whose
*How does the ARTO token work within the platform as a use case?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*ARTO will become a utility token for ecommerce transactions, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently, when an art collector buys an legacy artwork, the customer has the option to pay via PayPal, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. We're also planning to add other coins or tokens going forward. By using ARTO instead of PayPal, we will also incentivize our customers by giving them an additional discount.
Since ETH gas is really crazy nowadays, we believe the extra discount should be sufficient for the customer.
Other payment mechanisms are planned because we believe that ETH gas prices may present a challenge for some art collectors on large purchases. More on this in the next few months.*


# vDodus
*This is really interesting, so how would NFT to canvas proces work? That is somewhat unique product that you provide, i do not think i have heard about it before(uređivano)*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)


*Correct. It is unique because we're likely the first platform to offer such a service to our customers. We've already alpha test this function with our NFT to canvas suppliers, and it's working well. Once it's fully tested, we will do a beta test for some customers in the coming months.
Most people buy an NFT, and keep on their mobile devices. Going forward, they can turn that NFT into a canvas that they can hang on their walls or showcase in their offices.
Currently, we're alpha testing our integration with the OpenSea.io production API. In the coming weeks, we will showcase all 13 million NFTs from OpenSea on Exhibition gallery. 
OpenSea is our first integration partner; however, we're planning to integrate with other NFT focused blockchains as well.*


# Value Whose
*This will be really cool to see once live
Think we are going to ask one last question and then open up the chat for our community to ask some questions, sound good?*


# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Yes, it's a game changer in my humble view. That's why we believe that we will be the bridge between legacy artworks and NFT and vice versa going into 2021 and beyond.
Yes, we're ready for any community questions. The top 5 questions will receive 30 ARTO tokens.*

# vDodus
*Sounds like you have bright future ahead and i wish you the best*

*So the last question is related to FaaS, you chose to launch your token here, but we received some negative feedback, people were mostly worried about such a long lock of rewards, could you clear up for our community the reasoning behind it?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Yes, of course. We understand those concerns, and it's all valid. From our analysis of previously launched projects on FAAS, we noticed that some traders were simply selling those FAAS rewards as quickly as they received them, which cause erratic prices on ValueDefi, Uniswap, and other DEXs. With this approach we're aiming to mitigate those adverse conditions, while protecting the interests of our liquidity providers that believe in our project.(uređivano)*

# Value Whose
*Vesting schedules for token releases is a great way to help reduce immediate sell pressure so you are right with choosing this method as it has proven to work. We are going to open up chat here for community questions. Have at it!*

# vBOND MAXI
*Hello sers, thankyou for taking the time to do this vAMA. You mentioned eth gas prices, are you afraid, much like many other NFT projects that the eth chain is becoming unsustainable? Do you have plans to move to or exist on another chain?*

# Carlos Lugo (Guest)
*We're always looking to improve with the end user in mind so considering other chains is always a topic of discussion.*

# Value Whose
*FLOW is a popular choice if you aren't looking at it*

# Carlos Lugo (Guest)
*Thank you we will look into that. Flare although it has not launched yet is also interesting.*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*We're discussing this underlying issue with our team, and some future options included Binance Smart Contract, Polkadot, and other blockchains.*

# vBOND MAXI
*Good to hear you are open to it at least thx
Why use EG over opensea or rarible? especially if they just steal your idea for NFT -> Canvas which i can imagine bigger players being able to implement faster*

# vLostmyWife
*Will Arto eventually become a governance token as well?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Great question. That's one of initiatives going into 2021. We believe that a governance function will help put this project on a more decentralized pathway. Plus, it will serve a good purpose to help us decide who should win our call for an entry artist's grant too.*

# vBOND MAXI
*& not a question but more of a comment - the idea to go NFT to canvas is something some may think is a silly idea but as someone that knows absolutely nothing about physical art, i've actually struggled to know where to start because i recently purchased an NFT art piece from rarible that i do want to hang in my home*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Wonderful question. Let me explain it this way. Before Google became Google, they partnered with Yahoo. Google used the Yahoo index. Nowadays, who's using Yahoo for search? Competition is good, and we welcome it. The more NFTs are converted to canvas, the better it is for all artists globally*

# vBOND MAXI
*Good ethos. I think if you get the canvas functionality off the ground fast, I guess the idea is rarible / opensea could partner with you for that functionality? Any ETA for when it will be ready? I don't see it on your roadmap*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Overall, we intentionally kept many ideas off our roadmap because we only wanted to share it first. Once we have a fully functional NFT to canvas protocol, and our integration is working well, we will also pitch this idea to OpenSea since we're one of their integration partners. We expect some NFT collectors will also like to take their NFT from digital to canvas and hang it in their homes for friends and family to see.*

# vD.T
*NFT is unique, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I imagine NFT -> physical art is that you're going to digital print it. How are you going to maintain the uniqueness of NFT with digital printing like that, as anyone can print from a digital image I guess?*

# vBOND MAXI
*I think this argument has existed forever. The same reason people buy prints of existing art. The original(s) will always be more valuable, but it is distributed to make sure more people can enjoy it. One of the reasons NFTs are often minted in quantities not singular. Good question this brings up though*

# DevObs
*If your token is supposed to be used as a means of payment, why did you limit the total supply to 888K? Do you think this will be enough to meet demand?  Can you mint more than 888K ARTO?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Yes, we did. Initially, we thought it should be 88 million, but with that max supply, ARTO prices might become erratic over time. The low max supply ensures that we retain its value over time.*

# DevObs
*Thanks.  Can you mint more than 888K ARTO?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*We're not planning on minting any more ARTO tokens. From a philosophical view, we arguably see that ARTO is like a work of art, it's either limited edition or one of kind. However, as we progress and if demands prevail, we will always be opened to new ideas from our team and community.(uređivano)*

# DevObs
*What is your communication & marketing strategy to promote EG?*

# Miyasato Masa (Exhibition Gallery*)
*Overall, we're gradually ramping up our social media campaigns, which include Twitter, and Telegram. In the coming weeks, we will be promoting EG on Facebook and Google Ads. This week, we will be sending out an official press release announcing our partnership with ValueDeFi and OpenSea. Plus, we've also joined many non-profit organizations and museums. This will be listed on our website in the coming weeks. To protect the copyright of artists, we' also joined the DMCA or copyright.gov as a registered agent.
