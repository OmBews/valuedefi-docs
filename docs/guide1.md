**How to use Chi gastokens on ValueLiquid:**

1. Buy/mint CHI gas tokens from 1inch

2. Go to ValueLiquid.io

3. Select settings in upper right corner

4. Click ON on “Use CHI”

5. Approve CHI gastoken spending

6. You can now trade and save up to 40% of gas fees

In order for CHI gastokens to have maximum efficiency, gas price when using them should be twice as much when minting, so for example 25 gwei gas while minting, 50 gwei when spending/burning
