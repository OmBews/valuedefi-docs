### BENEFITS OF HOLDING VALUE 

Holders can stake their VALUE tokens into the [vGovernance](../products/vGovernance) and participate in making governance decisions through voting. This includes voting on strategies and their parameters, token emission schedules and sharing of the profits made by the platform.

Besides holders who have put their VALUE in the [vGovernance](../products/vGovernance) currently receive 14% of the profit made by Value Vaults and 35% of the swap fees made from trades on [vSwap](../products/vSwap) from Ethereum ecosystem. These percentages are subject to changes from Governance voting.
